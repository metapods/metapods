# Handlers

This folder contains [Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) route handlers. If you've worked in webservers in other languages, it's similar to the concept of controllers. 

It's common to see a handler take some information and spit it to something in `lib`. This is because handlers convert web-server knowledge to buisness-logic rather than do everything at once.
